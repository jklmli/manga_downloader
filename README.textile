h1. Manga-Downloader

Manga-Downloader is a cross-platform Windows/Mac/Linux Python 2/3 script.
It can be automated via an external .xml file, and can convert images for viewing on the Kindle.
Currently supports mangafox.com, mangareader.net, mangapanda.com and mangahere.com with a total
of over 10,000 mangas. Downloads into .cbz format, can optionally download into .zip instead.

h2. Dependencies

Python 2.6+, including 3.x

PIL if using Kindle conversion.

How to backport to:
2.5 - change the exception-handling code and use StringIO instead of io module
2.4 - removing parentheses after class declarations

The script will offer a choice of 3 manga sites, it will default to the first upon pressing 'enter'.
After selecting a site, the script will output a list of all chapters of the series it has found on the site you selected.  
When it prompts "Download which chapters?", type in the ones you want delimited by '-' and ','.  You can also type 'all' if you did not specify @--all@ before.

h2. Bugs

* Input between the two prompts "Which site?" and "Download which chapters?" is queued up for chapter selection.

h2. Issues

* Careful! MangaFox sometimes leaves up invalid chapters that it has marked for deletion.  Be suspicious of out-of-order chapters if they appear.
* The script can be a bandwidth hog when downloading a lot of manga chapters and @--threads@ is set to a large number. 
* UNICODE characters have caused the script issues in the past. If a UNICODE issue is found, create a new issue under the Issue tab and 
* provided a detailed description of the issue. 

h2. History

*v0.9.0* (06/13/11)
+ Support for Python 3.x

*v0.8.8a* (06/02/11)
+ Code cleanup for clarity, adherence to naming conventions

*v0.8.8* (02/11/11)

*v0.8.7* (02/05/11)
+ Fixed unicode issue. One of the found manga's contained a nonascii character. This caused the script to crash. I fixed the localized area.
  However, there are probably similar issues elsewhere in the code. I currently did not have time to hunt for similar issues. 
+ Manga Fox search has changed the matches are not as exact. If the matches take multiple pages, the script fails to find any manga after
  page one. I have modified the search in the script to match on the beginning. If zero mangas are found it reverts to the old search.
