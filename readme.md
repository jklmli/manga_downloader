# Manga-Downloader

**Note: There is an ongoing rewrite in the [1.0.0 branch](https://github.com/jiaweihli/manga_downloader/tree/1.0.0) 
(pull requests welcome!), which will break backwards-compatibility with the current version (0.x).  
Once it's released, this version will be deprecated and all development and support will be dropped.**

Manga-Downloader is a cross-platform Windows/Mac/Linux Python 2/3 script.

It can be automated via an external xml file, and can convert images for viewing on the Kindle.

Currently supports mangafox.com, mangareader.net, mangapanda.com and mangahere.com with a total
of over 10,000 mangas. Downloads into .cbz format, can optionally download into .zip instead.

## Dependencies

Python 2.7+, including 3.x

PIL if using Kindle conversion.

How to backport to:

  - 2.5 - change the exception-handling code and use `StringIO` instead of `io` module
  - 2.4 - removing parentheses after class declarations

## Usage

`manga.py [options] <manga name> <manga name> <etc.>`

The script will offer a choice of 3 manga sites, it will default to the first upon pressing 'enter'.

After selecting a site, the script will output a list of all chapters of the series it has found on
the site you selected.

When it prompts "Download which chapters?", type in the ones you want delimited by '-' and ','.
You can also type 'all' if you did not specify `--all` before.
